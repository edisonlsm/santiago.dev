Hello there :)

I'm Edison, a 26 years old geek from Curitiba, Brazil who is always looking forward to improve peoples lives with technology. Software is turning the world into a better place.

I create apps for mobile phones since the beginning of my professional career, which now accounts for over 6 years. I also work on everything else that is needed to make a mobile app alive, like APIs, databases, admin panels and so on.


**I'm currently developing experiences @ [Stapp Studio](https://stapp.studio).**
